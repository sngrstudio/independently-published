Hi, I’m Joan, and these are my adventures.

I’ve always had a desire to write, ever since I was little. If paper was laying around for too long, you can be sure I’d use it for my next creation. Of course pictures came with this as well. Visually explaining my writings through illustrations was a natural occurrence. As time progressed, my love for illustration grew into photography. Today, photographs riddle my writings to help encapsulate each adventure.

Thanks for visiting my site.
