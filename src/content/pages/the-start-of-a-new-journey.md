The hero archetype has been known throughout history, and their story follows the hero’s journey. It is the cycle of being sent out on an adventure, encountering troubles and challenges, reaching a final symbolic death and rebirth, and finally returning to their former environment with newfound knowledge and understanding. We see this countless times in stories, in mythology, and in religion. Today it is my turn.

I’m setting off on a journey to understand various cultures throughout the world. During this time, I hope to gain empathy and insight into how the world is seen differently by each culture. I will most certainly encounter perils and challenges that will cause great trepidation, but with love, I will overcome. My worry is the final symbolic moment where I might hope to be reborn with fresh new insights and experiences. But my greater dread is the possibility that the point of rebirth may not come at all. I will keep my eyes wide, take in all that I can, and throw caution to the wind.

I am ready to grow. I am ready to share my experiences.
