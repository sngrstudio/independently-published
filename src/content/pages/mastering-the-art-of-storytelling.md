Storytelling is possibly one of the oldest forms of communication. Today it’s used to sell products, create awareness, and engage people. If you desire to become an influencer, a leader, or even a teacher, then storytelling is something you need to master.

A clear and engaging story will be long remembered. The impact created through a story is much more deeply rooted than simple slides shared in an online presentation.

One of the first steps to mastering storytelling is starting with a good story. Good stories are all around us, but when getting started it’s best to pick a simple story with basic elements. Comedians do this regularly. They pull from real life events and exaggerate the details to entertain their audience.

Step two is to adapt the story to the audience. A good story involves both the storyteller and those with which you’re communicating. Stimulate their senses with descriptive words and draw the audience closer by relating them to the protagonist.

Through this all, keep the story brief and simple. Going down tangential routes will lose your audience. Think about the emotions you want to evoke, the response you hope to elicit, and the purpose or message you’re trying to communicate through the story. Communication happens in the details. Know your story well and bring it to life.
